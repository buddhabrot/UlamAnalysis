# Ulam Divisor Analysis

Repo that tries to collect some findings on the Ulam spiral analysis.

## Definitions

The Ulam spiral is drawn by spiraling out numbers from the inside towards the outside, typically in counter-clockwise fashion. In my definition, I rotate it 90 degrees to suit the ease of some formulae.

This makes the spiral look like this:



## Main Findings

The Ulam

From rendering various Ulam spirals, it seems the factors of numbers form "clusters" in the spiral that are repeated in the horizontal and vertical direction. These clusters all seem to be able to be modeled by polynomials in n, that generate a specific cluster of numbers for certain n.
